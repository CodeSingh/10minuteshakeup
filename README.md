# 10minuteshakeup
This project is something that my kids have insipred me to do. The whole family really enjoyed the 10 minutes shakeups that were used as a fun get the whole family active for 10 mins a day.

The only thing missing from the Change4Life project is a mobile app / web site where families can search for shakeups and play the shakeups straight from the app / mobile website.

With this in mind we have created a small example website which allows users to look through shakeups, select a shakeup and then run a countdown timer all from the website.

For information the website is a single page website using VueJS (vue.js) framework.
